# Portfolio-Project-s-Series
This portfolio series demonstrates a strong foundation in core data analyst skills across multiple projects. It begins with SQL, where complex queries are used for data exploration, aggregation, and cleaningâ€”essential for extracting actionable insights from raw data. The Tableau visualization project showcases the ability to design interactive dashboards that communicate findings clearly and effectively to stakeholders. In the data cleaning project, data preprocessing techniques are applied using SQL to ensure data integrity and usability. Finally, the correlation analysis project utilizes Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to perform statistical analysis and visualize relationships between variables. Together, these projects highlight a comprehensive skill set in data manipulation, visualization, and analytical storytelling.
